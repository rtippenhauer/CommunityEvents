# DinnerBears.com — Claude Code Project Context

## Project Overview
Community dining platform that organizes weekly group dinners across multiple cities.
Initial cities: Cincinnati and Dayton (cincinnati.dinnerbears.com, dayton.dinnerbears.com).
Self-hosted on Unraid using Docker Compose. Invite-only membership.

## Full Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular 19, standalone components (NO NgModules), Angular Material (MDC), SCSS
- **Backend:** NestJS (Node.js, TypeScript), TypeORM, Passport.js
- **Database:** MySQL 8.x
- **Auth:** JWT sessions + Google OAuth + Facebook OAuth (Passport strategies)
- **Email:** Brevo SDK (primary) + Resend (overflow fallback)
- **Push:** Web Push API with VAPID keys (@angular/pwa service worker)
- **Proxy:** NGINX Proxy Manager (Docker)
- **Containers:** Docker Compose — api and mysql have NO public ports

## Current Development Phase
**Post-Launch Backlog** — Claude automation tooling round completed 2026-07-06: dedicated automation-role account with its own scoped endpoints (release read/draft-create/unpublish), Docker build now reports the deployed `package.json` version and git commit via `/api/v1/health`, release 1.3.5 cut. No open backlog items right now — see PHASES.md for phase history; add new deferred items here as they come up.

## Completed Phases
Phases 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 7.5, 7.6, 8, 9, 10, 10.5, 10.6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 16c, 17 ✓ — see PHASES.md for details.

## Angular Conventions (STRICT)
- **Standalone components only** — never use NgModules
- **Reactive Forms only** — never use template-driven forms
- **Typed services for all HTTP** — never call HttpClient directly in components
- **Angular Signals** for local state
- **Functional route guards** — use `CanActivateFn`
- **Lazy-loaded routes** — each feature is a lazy route group
- **Angular Material** — use Mat components wherever one exists

## NestJS Conventions (STRICT)
- **One module per feature** — AuthModule, UsersModule, RestaurantsModule, etc.
- **DTOs with class-validator** for all request bodies
- **Guards for all protected routes** — never trust client role state
- **TypeORM repositories** — no raw SQL except in migrations
- **Global prefix** `/api/v1` set in main.ts
- **Never expose stack traces** — GlobalExceptionFilter handles all errors

## Database
- MySQL 8.x via TypeORM
- `synchronize: false` always — migrations only
- Migrations in `api/src/database/migrations/` with timestamp prefix
- See `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` for full schema

## Bug-Driven Development Workflow

When asked to work on bugs, Claude Code should:

1. Call `GET /api/v1/admin/feedback/open-bugs` to retrieve all open bug tickets
2. Present the list to Rob and ask which to work on
3. Implement the fix
4. Call `PATCH /api/v1/admin/feedback/:id/status` with `{status: "resolved"}` on the fixed ticket
5. Add an admin note via `POST /api/v1/admin/feedback/:id/notes` summarizing what was changed

## Versioning Workflow

`package.json` version and the public release version (`/admin/releases/new`,
stored in the `releases` table) are separate. Version numbers only change via
the `/release` command, and only when Rob gives the number explicitly — never
bump it proactively.

When asked to cut a release:

1. Summarize all changes made in the session (features added, bugs fixed)
2. Recommend a semver bump: patch for bug-only, minor for any new features
3. Draft release note copy for Rob to review
4. When Rob gives a version number, run `/release <version>`, which:
   - Creates the release as an **unpublished draft** via `POST
     /api/v1/admin/releases` against production (cookie-authenticated as
     admin — never calls the `/publish` endpoint)
   - Bumps `package.json` version in both workspaces, commits, tags, pushes
   - Builds/pushes the stage and prod Docker images
5. Rob reviews the draft and publishes it himself via the admin UI at
   `/admin/releases/new` — publishing is always a manual, separate action,
   never done by Claude
